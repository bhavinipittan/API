## Authentication
The API uses token-based authentication. After a successful login, you'll receive a token that should be included in subsequent requests as an `X-CSRF-Token` header.

Example:
```sh
curl -H "X-CSRF-Token: your_token" https://api.srmacademia.com/attendance
```

## Error Handling
The API returns appropriate HTTP status codes:
- **200**: Success
- **400**: Bad Request (missing parameters)
- **401**: Unauthorized (invalid token)
- **403**: Forbidden (access denied)
- **429**: Too Many Requests (rate limit exceeded)
- **500**: Server Error

## Rate Limiting
Requests are limited to **500 requests per 15-minute window** to prevent abuse.

## Caching
Responses are cached for **2 minutes** to improve performance and reduce load on the SRM servers.
